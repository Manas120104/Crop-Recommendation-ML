## üéØ Overview

This project presents an intelligent crop recommendation system that leverages supervised machine learning to optimize agricultural decision-making. By analyzing soil properties and environmental conditions, the system provides data-driven crop suggestions to maximize yield potential and support sustainable farming practices.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **ü§ñ Advanced ML Pipeline**: Comprehensive comparison of classical and state-of-the-art algorithms including neural networks, XGBoost, and ensemble methods
- **üìä Intelligent Data Processing**: Robust EDA, preprocessing, and feature engineering pipeline
- **üéõÔ∏è Optimized Performance**: Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for maximum predictive accuracy
- **üî¨ Ensemble Intelligence**: Custom ensemble models that combine multiple algorithms for enhanced prediction reliability
- **üìà Actionable Insights**: Data-driven recommendations for yield optimization strategies

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/Keras
- **Data Analysis**: pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn
- **Model Optimization**: GridSearchCV, cross-validation
- **Dataset**: Kaggle Agricultural Dataset (soil & environmental features)

## üìä Dataset Details

The dataset contains the following features used for crop classification:

**Data fields**
* `N` - ratio of Nitrogen content in soil
* `P` - ratio of Phosphorous content in soil
* `K` - ratio of Potassium content in soil
* `temperature` - temperature in degree Celsius
* `humidity` - relative humidity in %
* `ph` - ph value of the soil
* `rainfall` - rainfall in mm
* `label` - crop name

This is a **classification problem** where I used all the soil and environmental features (N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall) to predict the appropriate crop name using various machine learning models.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
Python 3.8+
Anaconda Distribution
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ML-Based-Crop-Recommender-System.git
   cd ML-Based-Crop-Recommender-System
   ```

2. **Install Anaconda**
   - Download Anaconda from [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system
   - Create a new conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n crop-recommender python=3.8
   conda activate crop-recommender
   ```
   - Install required packages:
   ```bash
   conda install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
   pip install xgboost
   ```

3. **Download the dataset**
   - Download `Crop_recommendation.csv` from Kaggle
   - Place it in the project directory

### Quick Start

You can explore the project through two main notebooks:

- **`Crop Prediction (80-20).ipynb`**: Implementation with 80-20 train-test split
- **`Crop prediction project.ipynb`**: Implementation with 70-30 train-test split

Download both notebooks to compare and analyze the effect of different train-test split ratios on model performance.
